Imperative programming
a style of programming where you write explicit instructions that describe how the computer should perform tasks step by step and manage state

Declarative programming
a style of programming where you describe what outcome you want and the underlying system figures out how to achieve it





Imperative Programming

A programming style where you write explicit instructions that describe how the computer should perform tasks step by step, 
while managing and maipulating program state directly.

Procedural Programming (PP): Organizes code into procedures/functions that execute in sequence (e.g., C, Pascal).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulates state and behavior into objects and uses concepts 
like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism (e.g., Java, C#, Python classes).

👉 Imperative = How to do it (focus on control flow and state changes).



Declarative Programming

A programming style where you describe what outcome you want, and the underlying system determines how to achieve it.

Functional Programming (FP): Uses pure functions, immutability, and composition to express computations 
(e.g., Haskell, Elixir, JavaScript with map/filter/reduce).

Logic Programming: Uses facts and rules to let the system infer solutions via logical reasoning (e.g., Prolog, Datalog).
Other examples: SQL for querying data, HTML for describing structure.

👉 Declarative = What you want, not how to get it.

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

OOP is an Imperative programming paradigm that structures software around objects—self-contained units
encapsulating both state (data/properties) and behavior (methods/functions).
It promotes modularity, reusability, and clarity by modeling programs closer to real-world entities.





Four Main Pillars of OOP
1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods that operate on that data into one unit (the object), while restricting direct external access to the internal state. Only the necessary details are exposed through controlled interfaces.

JavaScript Example:

class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // private field

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount();
account.deposit(100);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 100






2. Inheritance

Inheritance allows new classes to reuse, extend, and specialize the behavior of existing classes. This promotes code reusability and logical hierarchy.

JavaScript Example:

class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("woof");
  }
}

const a = new Animal();
const d = new Dog();
a.speak(); // sound
d.speak(); // woof






3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables the same method name to exhibit different behavior depending on the object invoking it. It makes code flexible and extensible.

Method Overriding (common in JS)

Method Overloading (not natively supported in JS but can be simulated)

JavaScript Example:

const a = new Animal();
const d = new Dog();

a.speak(); // sound
d.speak(); // woof






4. Abstraction

Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential functionality. It helps reduce complexity and increases clarity.

In JavaScript, true abstract classes don’t exist, but you can simulate them with base classes that enforce contracts.

JavaScript Example:

class Shape {
  area() {
    throw new Error("Subclass must implement area()");
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(r) {
    super();
    this.r = r;
  }
  area() {
    return Math.PI * this.r * this.r;
  }
}

const c = new Circle(5);
console.log(c.area()); // 78.5398...




👉 Short Interview-Ready Definition

OOP is a declarative paradigm where programs are structured around objects that encapsulate state and behavior, 
following the four principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

// creating objects

// 1. Object literal - most common way
const o1 = {};

// 2. Object constructor
const o2 = new Object();

// 3. Object.create() - creates object with specified prototype
const o3 = Object.create({}); // the arg is the prototype of the new object

// 4. Using a class (ES6+)
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this.prop = "value";
  }
}
const o4 = new MyClass();

// 5. Using a function constructor (pre-ES6)
function MyFunc() {
  this.prop = "value";
}
const o5 = new MyFunc();

// 6. Using Object.assign() to clone or merge objects
const o6 = Object.assign({}, { a: 1, b: 2 });

// 7. Using JSON.parse() for deep cloning (from JSON string)
const o7 = JSON.parse('{"x":10,"y":20}');

// 8. Using Object.fromEntries() (ES2019+)
const o8 = Object.fromEntries([
  ["key", "value"],
  ["foo", "bar"],
]);

console.log(o1, o2, o3, o4, o5, o6, o7, o8);

// key of object is always a string or a symbol

o1[30] = 30;
o1["30"] = 50;

console.log(o1); // { '30': 50 } - keys are always strings

//---------------------

/*

class
A blueprint for creating objects It groups data (properties) and behavior (methods) together Example

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}


constructor
A special method inside a class that runs when a new object is created with new It initializes the object’s properties

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
const p = new Person("Ali"); // constructor is called


super
A keyword used to call the constructor or methods of a parent class

class Animal {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super("dog"); // calls Animal constructor
    this.name = name;
  }
}


static methods and properties
are individual pieces of data and methods that belongs to the class itself and called on it, not on instances of the class.

class MathHelper {
  static pi = 3.14;             // static property
  static add(a, b) { return a + b; } // static method
}
console.log(MathHelper.pi);
console.log(MathHelper.add(2, 3));


instance methods
Functions defined inside a class that belong to the objects created from it

class Car {
  drive() {
    console.log("Driving...");
  }
}
const c = new Car();
c.drive(); // instance method call


inheritance
The mechanism that allows one class to extend another and reuse its properties and methods Done with the extends keyword

class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal sound");
  }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Meow");
  }
}
const kitty = new Cat();
kitty.speak(); // Meow

*/

/*  instance methods are methods that belongs to the object (instance) created from the class
 static method methods belong to the class not the instances (objects) created from the class



 "this" in static refers to the class itself
 "this" in instance methods refers to the instance (object) created from the class */

/* 

getter
A special method that lets you access a property value like it were a normal field but the value is actually computed or returned from a function It is defined with the keyword get

class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}

const p = new Person("Ali", "Saleh");
console.log(p.fullName); // Ali Saleh (getter is called like a property)


setter
A special method that lets you assign a property value like it were a normal field but behind the scenes the function runs and handles the assignment or validation It is defined with the keyword set

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name; // use _ to avoid recursion with the setter
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(newName) {
    if (newName.length < 3) {
      throw new Error("Name too short");
    }
    this._name = newName;
  }
}

const p = new Person("Ali");
console.log(p.name); // Ali (getter called)
p.name = "Omar";     // setter called
console.log(p.name); // Omar

*/

/* 


Public fields and methods

Definition
Public fields and methods can be accessed from anywhere (inside the class, outside the class, or by instances).

Syntax
They are written normally without any special prefix.

Example

class Person {
  name; // public field

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() { // public method
    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const p = new Person("Ali");
console.log(p.name); // Ali (accessible)
p.greet();           // Hello, I am Ali

Private fields and methods

Definition
Private fields and methods are only accessible inside the class where they are defined. They cannot be accessed directly from outside.

Syntax
They are prefixed with #.

Example

class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // private field

  constructor(owner) {
    this.owner = owner;
  }

  deposit(amount) { // public method
    this.#increaseBalance(amount);
  }

  #increaseBalance(amount) { // private method
    this.#balance += amount;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount("Omar");
account.deposit(100);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 100
console.log(account.#balance);     // ❌ SyntaxError (cannot access private field)


we use private fields and methods to encapsulate internal details of a class, hiding them from outside access. 
This helps prevent unintended interference and keeps the public interface clean and easy to use.
old days we used naming conventions like _privateField to indicate something is private 
but it was just a convention and not enforced by the language
also we used closures to create private variables but that made it hard to use inheritance and prototypes


const counter = (function () {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: function () {
      return count++;
    },
    decrement: function () {
      return count--;
    },
    getCount: function () {
      return count;
    },
  };
})();

*/

/* 

static initialization blocks 


class MyClass {
  static myStaticProperty;
  
  static {
    // This block runs once when the class is defined
    MyClass.myStaticProperty = "Initialized Value";
    console.log("Static block executed");
  }
}


the block runs once when the class is first evaluated, allowing you to set up static properties or perform one-time setup tasks for the class
it doesnt run when instances are created



a static block is a special block inside a class marked with static { ... }

it runs once when the class is evaluated (loaded)
it can initialize or compute values for static properties
it can contain any code (loops, if statements, function calls, etc)
it has access to this (refers to the class itself)

multiple blocks

you can declare more than one static block in the same class
they run in order of appearance



*/


/* 

keyword this is a special identifier that refers to the context in which the current code is executed

this can refer to in js

global object
normal function in global scope (non-strict mode → window in browser, global in node)

undefined
normal function in strict mode

instance of a class
inside constructor
inside non-static methods

class itself
inside static methods this refers to the class constructor

any object you choose
using .call() .apply() .bind() you can fix this manually

dom element
in a normal event handler function this is the element that fired the event

lexical outer scope
in arrow functions this is inherited from where the arrow was defined

*/




/* 



 
 
 the left of the dot rule in JavaScript is a simple way to remember what this refers to

👉 rule:
whatever is left of the dot . when you call a function determines the value of this inside that function

examples
const person = {
  name: "Ali",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

person.greet(); // "Ali"
// left of the dot is `person` → so `this = person`

const greetFn = person.greet;
greetFn(); 
// left of the dot is nothing (just a normal function call) → `this = undefined` (in strict mode) or `window` (in sloppy mode)

const other = { name: "Omar", greet: person.greet };
other.greet(); // "Omar"
// left of the dot is `other` → so `this = other`

special cases

Arrow functions ignore the left of the dot rule
they don’t have their own this, instead they use the this of the surrounding scope

const obj = {
  name: "Ali",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

obj.greet(); // undefined (arrow uses outer scope `this`, not `obj`)


Call / Apply / Bind override the rule explicitly

person.greet.call({ name: "Sara" }); // "Sara"
 
 
 */

/* 

key difference
normal function → this is decided every time you call it (who is left of the dot)
arrow function → this is locked to whatever it was in the place the arrow was created

*/

/* 

function Outer() {
  this.value = "I am from Outer";

  // normal function
  this.normal = function () {
    console.log("normal:", this.value);
  };

  // arrow function
  this.arrow = () => {
    console.log("arrow:", this.value);
  };
}

const outer = new Outer();

// call both normally
outer.normal(); // normal: I am from Outer
outer.arrow();  // arrow: I am from Outer

// extract the methods into variables
const n = outer.normal;
const a = outer.arrow;

n(); // normal: undefined  (lost its "this")
a(); // arrow: I am from Outer (still remembers outer's this!)

*/

/* 
why the value of this of isolated(detached) method defined in class differ from isolated method defined in object?

Classes automatically run in strict mode, so this in a detached class method is always undefined
Objects are not strict by default, so in sloppy mode a detached object method will use the global object (window) instead of undefined
That’s why you might see a difference



*/

/* 

ways to force setting "this" in a method (call, apply, bind)

call → runs now, arguments listed normally
apply → runs now, arguments given in an array
bind → does not run now, makes a new function with this locked forever

function show() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const obj1 = { name: "Ali" };
const obj2 = { name: "Sara" };

const bound1 = show.bind(obj1);
const bound2 = show.bind(obj2);

show.call(obj2);   // Sara   (original can still be rebound)
bound1.call(obj2); // Ali    (ignored, bound1 is locked to obj1)
bound2.call(obj1); // Sara   (ignored, bound2 is locked to obj2)

----------------------------

function show() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const obj1 = { name: "Ali" };
const obj2 = { name: "Sara" };

const result = show.bind(obj1).bind(obj2);

result(); // ??? // Ali - still bound to obj1, second bind is ignored




*/

/* 

Event listeners handlers or callback and "this"
In event listeners, this refers to the element that received the event  

Timers and "this"
In timer callbacks (setTimeout, setInterval), this is undefined in strict mode or the global object in sloppy mode. To preserve this, use an arrow function or bind.

Callback (map, filter, etc) functions and "this"
When passing methods as callbacks, this can be lost. Use bind or arrow functions to maintain the correct this context.


*/

/* 

new Array()
new Object()
new Dog("kiki",1.5)


the new keyword
When you use new with a function, it does the following:

1.Creates a blank object in memory
2.Links the new object’s internal prototype (__proto__) to the constructor’s .prototype property
3.Binds "this" inside the constructor to that new object
4.Executes the constructor function (passing any arguments you supplied)
5.Returns the newly created object (unless the constructor explicitly returns another object)



constructor function => function is used to create object in JS
function Dog(name, age){
   this.name = name;
   this.age = age;
}

Dog("kiki",1.5) => gets undefined , this refers to window or global object
new Dog("kiki",1.5) => creates a new object with name and age properties {name: "kiki", age: 1.5} and this refers to the object 


then the keyword new 
create new blank object in the memory 
(create link to the object's prototype)
links the new objects __proto__ to the constructors .prototype property 
bind this to the new object 
execute the constructor function 
returns the newly created object 

*/

/* 

1 Method on the prototype
function Dog(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
}
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  return `${this.name} says woof`
}

const d1 = new Dog("kiki", 1.5)
const d2 = new Dog("koko", 2)


bark lives once on Dog.prototype

Every instance (d1, d2) shares the same single function object

More memory efficient, better for performance when many instances are created

Typical OOP pattern in JS

2 Method inside constructor
function Dog(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
  this.bark = function() {
    return `${this.name} says woof`
  }
}

const d1 = new Dog("kiki", 1.5)
const d2 = new Dog("koko", 2)


bark is recreated separately for each new instance

Each dog has its own copy of the function in memory

Less efficient if you create many objects

But lets you have per-instance variations (you could change one dog’s bark without affecting others)


---------------------------

When you write a class like this

class Dog {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }

  bark() {
    return `${this.name} says woof`
  }
}


What JavaScript does under the hood is very similar to this constructor-function style

function Dog(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
}
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  return `${this.name} says woof`
}

Key points

Class methods (like bark) are automatically placed on Dog.prototype, not copied into each instance

They are also non-enumerable by default (won’t show in for...in loops)

The constructor inside the class is just a special method that becomes the function body of the class constructor

So classes are really syntactic sugar over constructor functions plus prototype assignments

*/

/* 

In “old JS” (before class syntax in ES2015) you had to wire inheritance manually with constructor functions and prototypes

Here’s the common pattern

1 Base constructor
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name
}

Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return `${this.name} is eating`
}

2 Child constructor
function Dog(name, breed) {
  // call parent constructor to initialize properties
  Animal.call(this, name) 
  this.breed = breed
}

3 Link prototypes
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype) // inherit methods
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog // fix constructor reference

//////////////////////////

NOTE

If you do
Dog.prototype = Animal.prototype


Both Dog and Animal now share the exact same prototype object
Any change you make to Dog.prototype also changes Animal.prototype (because they’re the same reference)
That breaks the idea of inheritance — you don’t want the child class polluting the parent

Correct way
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)


Creates a new empty object whose internal [[Prototype]] points to Animal.prototype
So Dog.prototype inherits from Animal.prototype instead of being the same object
You can safely add dog-specific methods without touching the parent




/////////////////////

4 Add child-specific methods
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  return `${this.name} says woof`
}

5 Usage
const d1 = new Dog("kiki", "husky")
console.log(d1.eat())  // kiki is eating  (from Animal)
console.log(d1.bark()) // kiki says woof  (from Dog)




*/

/* 

You can set the prototype of a plain object literal in a couple of ways

1 Using Object.setPrototypeOf
const animal = {
  eat() { return "eating" }
}

const dog = {
  bark() { return "woof" }
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(dog, animal)

console.log(dog.bark()) // woof
console.log(dog.eat())  // eating (inherited)

2 Using __proto__ inside an object literal (old but still works)
const animal = {
  eat() { return "eating" }
}

const dog = {
  __proto__: animal,
  bark() { return "woof" }
}

console.log(dog.eat()) // eating

3 Using Object.create directly
const animal = {
  eat() { return "eating" }
}

const dog = Object.create(animal, {
  bark: {
    value: function() { return "woof" }
  }
})

console.log(dog.eat()) // eating




*/

/* 

The prototype chain is how JavaScript resolves properties and methods when you access them on an object

How it works
When you try to read a property (obj.prop)
JS first looks for prop directly on obj
If not found, it looks at obj.__proto__ (same as Object.getPrototypeOf(obj))
If still not found, it keeps walking “up” the chain to the prototype’s prototype
This continues until it reaches Object.prototype
If not found there, result is undefined

*/

/* 

?? prototypes are just objects where shared functionality lives 


*/

/* 

prototype

A property that exists only on constructor functions / classes
It’s an object used as a template for new instances created with new
Any methods you want all instances to share should be placed on prototype

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name
}

Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  return `${this.name} says woof`
}

const d1 = new Dog("kiki")
console.log(d1.bark()) // woof


Here Dog.prototype is where bark lives

__proto__

A property that exists on every object instance
It’s a reference to the object’s internal prototype (i.e. the constructor’s prototype)
Used for lookup when you access properties

const d1 = new Dog("kiki")

console.log(d1.__proto__ === Dog.prototype) // true


So __proto__ connects an object to the prototype chain

Quick analogy
prototype = blueprint (defined on constructor)
__proto__ = actual link that each object carries to its blueprint

/* 

Concurrency in JavaScript refers to how JS can manage multiple tasks without running them all at the same exact time (since it has one main thread).


JS achieves this with the event loop, async callbacks, promises, and APIs.

While one task runs in the call stack, other tasks (I/O, timers, network requests) 
can progress in the background (handled by the browser or Node.js runtime).

*/


/* 

Example of Concurrency
function task1() {
  console.log("Task 1 done");
}
function task2() {
  setTimeout(() => console.log("Task 2 done"), 1000);
}
function task3() {
  console.log("Task 3 done");
}

task1();
task2();
task3();


Output:

Task 1 done
Task 3 done
Task 2 done   // after ~1 second


Even though JS is single-threaded, it looks concurrent because while waiting for task2’s timer, JS continues with task3.

Key Points

JS is single-threaded (one call stack).
The event loop enables non-blocking async behavior.
Concurrency is achieved by delegating tasks to the environment (Web APIs / Node.js libuv), then handling callbacks via the queue.
Promises and async/await use the microtask queue, which has higher priority than the normal task queue.

✅ memory trick:

Event loop = traffic controller 🚦
Concurrency = illusion of doing multiple things at once with async tasks.



Concurrency means the system is able to make progress on multiple tasks during the same period of time, even if not literally at the exact same instant.
In JavaScript:

The engine runs one piece of code at a time (single-threaded).
But while waiting for I/O (network, timers, events), other code can run.
Tasks interleave, so it looks like multiple things are happening at once.



Parallelism

Parallelism means code is literally executed at the exact same time (on different CPU cores or threads).
JS in the browser does not do parallel execution on the main thread.
But browsers/Node.js can use parallelism in background threads (e.g., Web Workers, libuv thread pool).



👉 memory trick:

Concurrency = dealing with many things at once (interleaving).
Parallelism = doing many things at the exact same time.

*/




/* 

Analogy

Interleaving (concurrency):
One chef cooking soup → stirs pot for 1 min, chops vegetables for 1 min, goes back to stirring, then chopping. Both tasks progress, 
but only one action at a time.

Parallelism:
Two chefs → one stirs soup continuously, the other chops vegetables at the same time.


In JavaScript

Because JS is single-threaded, async tasks are interleaved by the event loop:
It runs some synchronous code
Pauses when it hits an async operation (like setTimeout or fetch)
Picks up another task
When the async operation finishes, its callback is queued and run later
So tasks are not “parallel,” but interleaved in time slices.


*/




/* 

The event loop is a concept in the JavaScript runtime that defines how asynchronous operations are executed and managed.

The JS engine starts with synchronous code → pushes functions into the call stack.

If it encounters asynchronous code (like setTimeout, fetch, events), those are handed off to Web APIs / Node.js APIs (the background).

When those async tasks finish, their callbacks are placed into queues:
  Microtask queue → promise callbacks, queueMicrotask, MutationObserver.
  Macrotask (task) queue → setTimeout, setInterval, DOM events, network callbacks.

The event loop continuously checks:

If the call stack is empty → process microtasks (until empty).
Then → take the next macrotask, put it on the stack.
Repeat.


👉 microtasks always have higher priority than macrotasks.



*/










/* 
javascript itself is single threaded because it runs on the event loop model

but it achieves concurrency through
async callbacks / promises / async await → non blocking code on the same thread
web apis (like setTimeout fetch etc) handled by the browser or nodejs runtime
web workers → allow true multithreading by running code in separate background threads with message passing
*/

/* 
single thread concurrency
js has one call stack (the main thread)
when you do setTimeout, fetch, or async i/o the heavy work is passed to browser or node runtime apis (not js itself)
when that finishes it pushes the callback back into the event queue
the event loop checks if the call stack is free and executes the callback
so all js code still runs on the single main thread




real multithreading

this is when multiple threads of execution run truly in parallel on different cpu cores
js cannot do this with callbacks alone
only web workers (browser) or worker_threads (node) give real multithreading
each worker has its own isolated js engine instance and runs on another os thread

so

callbacks promises async/await → concurrency on one thread (non-blocking)
web workers / worker_threads → true multithreading


*/

/* 

Callback hell (also called the pyramid of doom) happens in JavaScript when you have many nested callbacks, 
making the code deeply indented, messy, and hard to maintain or debug.


Each async function depends on the result of the previous one.
The nesting creates a pyramid shape with many }) at the end.
Hard to read, test, and handle errors.

Callback hell = too many nested callbacks
Solutions: named functions, Promises, or best → async/await  

// NOTE>> await keyword pauses the surrounding async function, not the whole JS engine

*/

/* 
PROMISES

Promises are the modern way to handle asynchronous operations
a Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation

definition
it acts like a placeholder for a value that will be available later (success or failure)
[[one time guarantee for a future value]]
it can be in one of three states

pending → the async work has not finished yet
fulfilled → the work finished successfully, a value is available
rejected → the work failed, an error reason is available


*/

/* 

Promise chaining means linking multiple asynchronous operations one after the other using .then() 
so that the output of one promise becomes the input for the next.


each .then() returns a new promise
if you return a value → it is passed to the next .then()
if you return another promise → the next .then() waits for it to resolve

promise chaining = sequential async flow

async/await is modern JavaScript syntax (introduced in ES2017) built on top of Promises.
It makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability.

definition
async before a function means the function will always return a Promise
await pauses execution inside an async function until the awaited Promise resolves (or rejects)

pros
Code looks sequential and easier to read
Error handling uses normal try/catch
Still non-blocking (event loop runs while waiting)

async/await = syntactic sugar over Promises
async makes a function return a Promise
await pauses only the async function until the Promise settles

*/

/* 

if the function is marked async, it always returns a Promise
If you return a normal value, it gets wrapped in a resolved Promise
async function fetchData() {
  return "data"
} 
// equivalent to
async function fetchData() {
  return Promise.resolve("data")
}


*/

/* 
ways to return a Promise



async function → auto promise
new Promise → manual
Promise.resolve / Promise.reject → quick
return from built-in APIs like fetch, fs.promises, etc
combinators (Promise.all, race, etc)
.then() → always returns a promise
async generators


*/

/* 

what Promise.resolve(p) does
if p is already a promise → it returns the same promise untouched
if p is just a plain value → it wraps it in a resolved promise

*/

/* 

you can chain three fetches in two main styles async/await and promise chaining with .then().catch()


with async/await
async function fetchSequential() {
  try {
    const res1 = await fetch("https://api.example.com/step1");
    const data1 = await res1.json();
    console.log("first:", data1);

    const res2 = await fetch("https://api.example.com/step2");
    const data2 = await res2.json();
    console.log("second:", data2);

    const res3 = await fetch("https://api.example.com/step3");
    const data3 = await res3.json();
    console.log("third:", data3);

  } catch (err) {
    console.error("error:", err);
  }
}

fetchSequential();


the await keyword pauses each step until the fetch is done
the try/catch handles any error along the way



with .then().catch()
fetch("https://api.example.com/step1")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data1 => {
    console.log("first:", data1);
    return fetch("https://api.example.com/step2");
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data2 => {
    console.log("second:", data2);
    return fetch("https://api.example.com/step3");
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data3 => {
    console.log("third:", data3);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error("error:", err);
  });


each .then returns a new promise so the next .then waits for it
the .catch at the end will capture any error from the whole chain



by default a single .catch() at the end of the chain will handle errors from anywhere in the chain but you can also handle errors step by step if you want more control
add .catch() after each fetch


fetch("https://api.example.com/step1")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data1 => {
    console.log("first:", data1);
    return fetch("https://api.example.com/step2");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error("error in step1:", err);
    // rethrow if you want to stop further steps
    throw err;
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data2 => {
    console.log("second:", data2);
    return fetch("https://api.example.com/step3");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error("error in step2:", err);
    throw err;
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data3 => {
    console.log("third:", data3);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error("error in step3:", err);
  });

Promise combinator methods





Promise.all()
Definition: runs multiple promises in parallel and waits for all to fulfill

Behavior:
if all succeed → resolves to an array of results in order
if any one fails → rejects immediately (fail-fast)

Example
Promise.all([
  fetch("/a"),
  fetch("/b"),
  fetch("/c"),
])
  .then(([resA, resB, resC]) => console.log("all done"))
  .catch(err => console.error("one failed:", err));





Promise.allSettled()
Definition: runs multiple promises in parallel and waits for all to settle

Behavior:
never fail fast
returns an array of objects { status: "fulfilled", value } or { status: "rejected", reason }

Example
Promise.allSettled([
  fetch("/a"),
  fetch("/b"),
  fetch("/bad-url"),
])
  .then(results => {
    results.forEach(r => {
      if (r.status === "fulfilled") {
        console.log("ok:", r.value);
      } else {
        console.error("error:", r.reason);
      }
    });
  });





Promise.any()
Definition: runs multiple promises in parallel and waits for the first one that fulfills

Behavior:
resolves with the value of the first fulfilled promise
ignores rejections unless all reject → then rejects with AggregateError

Example
Promise.any([
  fetch("/bad-url"),
  fetch("/another-bad-url"),
  fetch("/good"),
])
  .then(result => console.log("first success:", result))
  .catch(err => console.error("all failed:", err)); // AggregateError




Promise.race()
Definition: runs multiple promises in parallel and settles as soon as the first one settles
Behavior:
if the first to finish fulfills → resolves with that value
if the first to finish rejects → rejects with that error

Example
Promise.race([
  fetch("/slow"),
  fetch("/fast"),
])
  .then(result => console.log("winner:", result))
  .catch(err => console.error("failed fast:", err));




quick comparison
all → wait for all, fail fast if any rejects
allSettled → wait for all, always gives you all states
any → succeed fast, only needs one fulfillment (AggregateError if all fail)
race → first to settle wins, whether success or error */

/* 

Generator in JavaScript is a special kind of function that can pause execution at yield expressions and resume later, 
allowing you to produce a sequence of values over time instead of computing them all at once

how to define

declared with an asterisk function*
use the yield keyword to return values one by one
calling a generator function does not run it immediately, it returns an iterator object
you call .next() on that iterator to step through execution

example
function* numberGen() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const gen = numberGen();

console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }

key points

lazy evaluation: values are generated only when requested
pause/resume: execution “pauses” at yield and continues when .next() is called again
done flag: tells you when the generator is finished

use cases

creating custom iterators
managing infinite sequences (like Fibonacci numbers, streams)
simplifying async workflows (before async/await, people used generators with libraries like co)
controlling execution flow


example 1


function* fetchUserFlow() {
  const user = yield fetch("/api/user").then(res => res.json());
  console.log("user:", user);

  const posts = yield fetch(`/api/posts?user=${user.id}`).then(res => res.json());
  console.log("posts:", posts);
}

// simple runner
function run(gen) {
  const iterator = gen();

  function step(nextValue) {
    const result = iterator.next(nextValue);
    if (result.done) return;
    result.value.then(step);
  }

  step();
}

run(fetchUserFlow);


example 2

function* fibonacci(a = 0, b = 1) {
  while (true) {
    yield a;
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
}

// helper to consume only k values from an infinite generator
function take(iter, k) {
  const out = [];
  for (const v of iter) {
    out.push(v);
    if (out.length === k) break;
  }
  return out;
}

console.log(take(fibonacci(), 10)); // [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]


more Usage

spread into an array

console.log([...numbers()]); 
// [1, 2, 3]


destructuring

const [a, b] = numbers();
console.log(a, b); // 1 2


manual loop

const gen = numbers();
let result = gen.next();
while (!result.done) {
  console.log(result.value);
  result = gen.next();
}

Iterator is an object that defines a sequence and allows you to step through it one item at a time.
An iterator must implement a method called next(), which returns an object with two properties:
value → the current item in the sequence
done → a boolean (false if there are more items, true if the sequence is finished)


Iterable is an object that implements the @@iterator method, available as [Symbol.iterator]().
Calling this method must return an iterator object. 
Iterables can be consumed by language constructs such as 
for...of, spread syntax (...), array destructuring, and other APIs expecting sequences.
Examples of built-in iterables: Array, String, Set, Map, TypedArray, and generator objects.



Example: Custom Iterator
function createIterator(arr) {
  let index = 0;
  return {
    next: function () {
      if (index < arr.length) {
        return { value: arr[index++], done: false };
      } else {
        return { value: undefined, done: true };
      }
    }
  };
}
--------------------------
just an iterator
the object returned has a .next() method → that makes it an iterator
but it does not implement [Symbol.iterator] → so it’s not iterable
you can call it.next() manually, but you cannot do for...of it
--------------------------


const it = createIterator(["a", "b", "c"]);

console.log(it.next()); // { value: "a", done: false }
console.log(it.next()); // { value: "b", done: false }
console.log(it.next()); // { value: "c", done: false }
console.log(it.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }

Example: Using [Symbol.iterator]

Any object can be made iterable by implementing the [Symbol.iterator] method that returns an iterator.

const myIterable = {
  data: [10, 20, 30],
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    let i = 0;
    return {
      next: () => {
        if (i < this.data.length) {
          return { value: this.data[i++], done: false };
        } else {
          return { value: undefined, done: true };
        }
      }
    };
  }
};


-----------------------------
an iterable (that produces iterators)
here the object defines [Symbol.iterator]
that means it’s an iterable → it can be used with for...of, spread syntax ([...myIterable]), destructuring, etc.
every time you call [Symbol.iterator]() you get a fresh iterator

myIterable is iterable (because it has [Symbol.iterator])
but it does not itself have a .next() method
instead, when you call myIterable[Symbol.iterator](), you get an iterator object that does have .next()
const iterator = myIterable[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 10, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 20, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 30, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
-----------------------------

for (const val of myIterable) {
  console.log(val); // 10, 20, 30
}

Key Points

An iterator is an object with a .next() method returning { value, done }.
An iterable is an object that implements [Symbol.iterator] to return an iterator.
All built-in collections (Array, String, Map, Set, arguments, TypedArrays) are iterable.
Generators (function*) automatically create iterators.
Iterators allow lazy evaluation (compute values only when needed).

Use Cases

Looping with for...of
for (const x of ["x", "y", "z"]) {
  console.log(x);
}

Spread syntax
console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 2, 3])]); // [1, 2, 3]

Custom data structures
Define your own iteration logic, like looping through a tree or graph.

Lazy sequences
Infinite sequences (like Fibonacci) or streams of data that aren’t computed until you ask for them.

Integration with Generators
Generators automatically return iterators, making them perfect for building complex sequences.

/* 

An iterator is an object with .next() that produces a sequence.
An iterable is an object that can give you an iterator via [Symbol.iterator].
In JS, some objects (like generators) are both iterators and iterables.


*/

/* 

1. Iterable

an iterable is an object that has a method [Symbol.iterator].
calling [Symbol.iterator]() gives you an iterator.
examples: arrays, strings, sets, maps, generators.
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(typeof arr[Symbol.iterator]); // "function"

2. Iterator

an iterator is an object with a .next() method.
.next() returns { value, done }.
examples: arr[Symbol.iterator]() or a generator object.
const it = arr[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(it.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }

3. Relationship

All iterables can produce iterators.
Not all iterators are iterables → because an iterator doesn’t have to implement [Symbol.iterator].
BUT in practice, most built-in iterators in JS are also iterables (they return themselves from [Symbol.iterator]).
Example: generator objects, array iterators.

*/

/* 

iterable is any object that implements the special method [Symbol.iterator].
examples of built-in iterables:

Arrays
Strings
Sets
Maps
Typed arrays
The arguments object in functions
Generator objects


----------------------------

special things about generator objects
why you can call .next() directly on a generator
when you call a generator function (function*) you get back a generator object
that object has:
a .next() method (so it’s an iterator)
a [Symbol.iterator]() method that returns this (so it’s also an iterable)


when you call a generator function like gen(), the object you get back is a generator object.
that object is both:

an iterator → because it has a .next() method (and also .return() and .throw()), so you can step manually through its sequence.
an iterable → because it has a [Symbol.iterator]() method that just returns itself. This is why you can use it in for...of, spread ([...gen()]), destructuring, etc.

*/

/* 

to make an object act like a generator object (both iterable and iterator at the same time), you need to give it:
a .next() method → so it can be used as an iterator.
a [Symbol.iterator]() method that returns this → so it can be used as an iterable.

example
const myIterableIterator = {
  data: [1, 2, 3],
  index: 0,

  next() {
    if (this.index < this.data.length) {
      return { value: this.data[this.index++], done: false };
    } else {
      return { value: undefined, done: true };
    }
  },

  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    return this; // returning itself makes it iterable
  }
};

// manual iteration (iterator style)
console.log(myIterableIterator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(myIterableIterator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }

// reset index if you want to iterate again
myIterableIterator.index = 0;

// for...of (iterable style)
for (const val of myIterableIterator) {
  console.log(val); // 1, 2, 3

/* 

Closures is an ability of a function to remember the variables and functions that are declared in its outer scope 
— even after that outer scope has finished executing.


Key Points

Functions carry scope with them
Inner functions have access to variables of their outer functions.

Persistent state
Even if the outer function has returned, the inner function keeps a reference to the outer variables, not a copy.

Private variables
You can use closures to emulate private state because outside code cannot directly access the enclosed variables.

Memory
Because closures keep variables “alive,” they can sometimes cause memory leaks if not managed carefully.




Examples



1. Basic Closure
function outer() {
  let counter = 0;
  function inner() {
    counter++;
    return counter;
  }
  return inner;
}

const fn = outer(); 
console.log(fn()); // 1
console.log(fn()); // 2
console.log(fn()); // 3


Here, fn is a closure: it remembers counter even though outer has finished executing.

2. Private State
function createBankAccount(initialBalance) {
  let balance = initialBalance;

  return {
    deposit(amount) {
      balance += amount;
      return balance;
    },
    withdraw(amount) {
      balance -= amount;
      return balance;
    },
    getBalance() {
      return balance;
    }
  };
}

const account = createBankAccount(100);
console.log(account.deposit(50));   // 150
console.log(account.withdraw(30));  // 120
console.log(account.getBalance());  // 120


balance is not accessible directly → it’s private inside the closure.

3. Closures with Event Handlers
function setupButton() {
  let count = 0;
  document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
    count++;
    console.log(`Button clicked ${count} times`);
  });
}
setupButton();


Even after setupButton finishes, the event handler keeps count alive.

4. Factory Functions
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function(x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
const triple = multiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 15


Each closure “remembers” its own factor.





Use Cases

Data privacy → emulate private variables.
Function factories → generate functions with preconfigured behavior.
Callbacks / event handlers → closures capture variables from the environment.
Memoization → store computed values across calls.
Module pattern → organize code with encapsulated state.-

*/

/* 


Hoisting in JavaScript is the behavior where variable and function declarations are moved (“hoisted”) to the top of their scope
(either global scope or function scope) during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.

Key Points

Only declarations are hoisted
Initializations/assignments are not hoisted.
Function declarations are fully hoisted
You can call a function declared with function before it appears in the code.

var is hoisted
Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top and initialized with undefined.

let and const are hoisted too
But they are put into the temporal dead zone (TDZ) until the declaration is executed → accessing them before declaration causes a ReferenceError.

Scope matters
Hoisting works within each function scope and block scope, not across everything globally.

Examples
1. Function Declaration Hoisting
sayHi(); // works, prints "Hi!"

function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hi!");
}

2. var Hoisting
console.log(x); // undefined (declaration hoisted, not assignment)
var x = 5;

3. let / const Hoisting
console.log(y); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
let y = 10;

console.log(z); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
const z = 20;

4. Function Expressions (not hoisted fully)
greet(); // TypeError: greet is not a function
var greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello");
};


*/

/* 

Special Add Exercise
Write a function called specialAdd. If you give this function a number, it
returns a new function to you. If you give this function no arguments, it
returns the total of all the numbers you've passed to it so far.

Examples:
specialAdd(); // 0
specialAdd(1)(2)(); // 3
specialAdd(2)(8)(5)(1)(); // 16

*/

function specialAdd(init) {
  if (init === undefined) return 0;
  return function innerSum(num) {
    if (num === undefined) return init;
    init += num;
    return innerSum;
  };
}

/* 

Debouncing is a programming technique used to limit how often a function is executed.
It ensures that a function runs only after a certain period of time has passed since the last time it was invoked.

Key Points

Used to control rapid events like keypress, resize, scroll, input.
The function execution is delayed until no new event happens within the wait period.
Prevents unnecessary computations or API calls.
Common in search boxes (wait until user stops typing before firing a request).

Example: Basic Debounce
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer); // reset if called again
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

*/


/* 

A Higher-Order Function (HOF) in JavaScript is a function that either 
Takes one or more functions as arguments, or Returns a function as its result, or both.



Key Points

Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript → they can be passed around just like values.
HOFs allow more abstraction and reusability.
Very common in functional programming style.
Built-in methods like map, filter, reduce, forEach are HOFs.




Examples



1. Function passed as an argument
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

function processUserInput(fn) {
  const name = "Hesham";
  return fn(name);
}

console.log(processUserInput(greet)); 
// "Hello, Hesham"




2. Function returning another function
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function (x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10



3. Built-in Array HOFs
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2); 
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

const evens = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]

const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15




Use Cases

Code reusability (abstracting repetitive logic).
Function composition (building bigger logic from small pieces).
Asynchronous control (e.g., passing callbacks to setTimeout, promises).
Event handling (pass handler functions).
Currying/partial application.

/* 

🔥 closures and higher-order functions (HOFs) are deeply connected in JavaScript

Relation

A higher-order function either takes a function as an argument or returns a function.
When a higher-order function returns a function, that returned function usually closes over (remembers) variables from the outer scope.
That’s where closures come in — they give the returned function access to the outer function’s variables even after the outer function has finished running.

So:
👉 Closures are the mechanism.
👉 Higher-order functions are the design pattern that often relies on closures.

*/

function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutid = null;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutid);
    timeoutid = setTimeout(function () {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}








/* 

Throttling is a technique used to control how often a function is executed.
It ensures that a function runs at most once within a specified time interval, no matter how many times it’s triggered.

Key Points

Opposite of debounce:
  Debounce → wait until the activity stops.
  Throttle → run regularly at fixed intervals.
Useful for events that fire very frequently (scroll, resize, mousemove).
Improves performance by reducing the number of function calls.
Can be implemented using setTimeout or timestamps.

Example: Throttle Implementation
function throttle(fn, delay) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

Usage Example
const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  console.log("Scroll event at:", Date.now());
}, 1000);

window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);


👉 Even if you scroll like crazy, the function logs only once per second.

Another Variant: Timeout-based Throttle
function throttle(fn, delay) {
  let timer = null;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!timer) {
      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        fn.apply(this, args);
        timer = null;
      }, delay);
    }
  };
}

Use Cases

Scroll events → update UI (e.g., infinite scroll, sticky header).
Resize events → recalculate layout only every X ms.
Mouse movement → track position without overloading.
Button spam → prevent multiple rapid clicks from triggering logic.

👉 memory trick:
Debounce = run after calm.
Throttle = run at intervals.



*/





/* 

throtlling issue with scroll 

pick a small enough throttle interval

if you throttle to ~100–200 ms, the UI is still responsive (5–10 updates per second)
the user doesn’t perceive lag, because the eye can’t catch gaps shorter than ~100 ms

combine throttle with a final call (trailing edge)

many implementations allow “leading” (run immediately) and “trailing” (run after the last event)
so when the user finishes scrolling, your function fires one last time and fills the screen



example using lodash:
window.addEventListener("scroll", _.throttle(loadMore, 200, { leading: true, trailing: true }));


*/





function throttle(func, delay, { leading = false, trailing = false } = {}) {
  let timer = null;
  let lastArgs = null;

  return function (...args) {
    const context = this;

    if (!timer) {
      if (leading) func.apply(context, args);

      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        if (trailing && lastArgs) {
          func.apply(context, lastArgs);
          lastArgs = null;
        }
        timer = null;
      }, delay);
    } else {
      // save latest args for trailing call
      lastArgs = args;
    }

Functional Programming (FP)

Functional Programming is a declarative programming paradigm where software is built by composing pure functions 
and avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects.
It emphasizes what to do rather than how to do it—in contrast with imperative programming, which describes step-by-step instructions.





🔑 Key Principles
1. Pure Functions

Always return the same output for the same input.

Have no side effects (do not modify external state).

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b; // pure, no side effects
}





2. Immutability

Data is never modified in place.

Instead, new copies are created when changes are needed.

const arr = [1, 2, 3];

// ❌ Imperative (mutates original)
arr.push(4);

// ✅ Functional (returns new array)
const newArr = [...arr, 4];





3. First-Class & Higher-Order Functions

Functions are treated like values.

They can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);         // [2, 4, 6, 8]
const evens   = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
const sum     = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // 10





4. Function Composition

Combine small, reusable functions to build more complex behavior.

const multiplyBy2 = x => x * 2;
const add3 = x => x + 3;

const composed = x => add3(multiplyBy2(x));
console.log(composed(5)); // 13





5. Declarative Style

Express what you want instead of how to achieve it.

Example: using map, filter, reduce instead of explicit for loops.





📌 Use Cases

Data transformations (filtering, mapping, reducing lists).
UI frameworks (e.g., React) use FP concepts (pure components, immutability).
Concurrency and parallelism (no shared mutable state = fewer bugs).
Writing safer, more predictable, and testable code.

✅ Pros

Predictable: same input → same output.
Easier testing and debugging.
Safer with async/parallel code.
Encourages modular, reusable design.


❌ Cons

Potentially less performant (extra object/array copies).
Can feel abstract and harder for those used to imperative loops.

👉 Short Interview-Ready Definition

Functional Programming is a declarative paradigm that builds software 
by composing pure, immutable functions and avoiding side effects, focusing on what to do rather than how to do it.

/* 

Functional Programming (FP) vs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

🔹 Functional Programming (FP)
Core Idea: Build programs by composing pure functions.
Focus: What to do (declarative).
State/Data: Immutable (never changes).
Behavior: Functions transform data and return new values.
Reusability: Achieved through function composition.
Examples in JS: map, filter, reduce, pure helper functions.

// FP example: double all numbers
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2); // [2, 4, 6]




🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Core Idea: Build programs by modeling objects with state + behavior.
Focus: How to do it (imperative).
State/Data: Mutable (objects hold state that can change).
Behavior: Methods act on the object’s internal state.
Reusability: Achieved through inheritance and polymorphism.
Examples in JS: Classes, objects with methods.




// OOP example: double all numbers
class Doubler {
  constructor(nums) {
    this.nums = nums;
  }
  double() {
    return this.nums.map(n => n * 2);
  }
}

const d = new Doubler([1, 2, 3]);
console.log(d.double()); // [2, 4, 6]

/* 

🔹 React with OOP (Class Components)

Before React 16.8, the main way to handle state & lifecycle was with classes.
Fits OOP → each component is an object with state (mutable) and methods (lifecycle functions).


OOP traits:

Encapsulation (this.state is internal).
Methods (render, increment).
Mutable state (this.setState changes it).



🔹 React with FP (Functional Components + Hooks)

Modern React favors functions.
Functions + hooks make components stateless by default, adding state via closures (useState).
functional programming style → pure functions, immutable updates.


FP traits:

Counter is just a pure function of props → UI.
useState uses closures to manage state.
Updates are immutable (setCount(c => c + 1)).
Hooks (useEffect, useMemo) encourage composition, not inheritance.

/* 


Pure Functions

A pure function is a function that:
Given the same input, always produces the same output
Has no side effects (doesn’t modify external state, doesn’t depend on external mutable state)

Key Properties
Deterministic → same input → same output
No side effects → doesn’t change variables outside its scope, 
doesn’t do I/O like writing to a file or updating the DOM
Testable → easy to test because output only depends on input
Composable → can be combined with other pure functions safely




Examples


✅ Pure
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(add(2, 3)); // always 5



❌ Impure (side effect: changing external variable)
let counter = 0;

function increment() {
  counter++;   // modifies external state
  return counter;
}

console.log(increment()); // depends on external state

❌ Impure (non-deterministic: uses Date)
function getCurrentTime() {
  return new Date().toISOString(); // depends on system time
}

Use Cases

Functional programming (building blocks are pure functions)
Predictable state updates (e.g., Redux reducers in React must be pure)
Easier testing (just check inputs/outputs)
Safer concurrency (no shared state mutation)


*/
// additional pure vs impure function example
const baselineCart = Object.freeze([
  { id: 1, qty: 1 },
  { id: 2, qty: 2 }
])

function addItemPure(cart, item) {
  return [...cart, item] // pure: returns new array, leaves input untouched
}

let sharedCart = [...baselineCart]

function addItemImpure(item) {
  sharedCart.push(item) // impure: mutates external state
  return sharedCart
}

const newCart = addItemPure(baselineCart, { id: 3, qty: 1 })
console.log(newCart)
console.log(baselineCart) // unchanged

console.log(addItemImpure({ id: 3, qty: 1 }))
console.log(addItemImpure({ id: 4, qty: 1 })) // result depends on sharedCart


/* 

✅ When to Use Pure Functions

Use pure functions when you want:

Predictability
Pure functions always return the same result for the same inputs.
Example: sum(a,b) → easy to reason about.

Testability
Since they don’t depend on external state, they’re easy to test in isolation.

Reusability & Composition
Pure functions can be combined to form more complex logic without side effects.

Immutability / Functional style
In state management (e.g., React reducers, Redux), pure functions ensure predictable state updates




✅ When to Use Impure Functions

Sometimes impure functions are necessary because programs must interact with the outside world:


I/O Operations
Reading from/writing to a database, file, or network.
Logging to console.

User Interaction
Updating the DOM in a browser.
Handling clicks, keypresses, etc.

Randomness / Time
Math.random() or Date.now() are inherently impure because they depend on external state (system clock, RNG).

Side Effects by Design
If your program must cause a visible effect (UI update, API call), you have to use impure functions

*/




/* 

Referential Transparency means: an expression can be replaced by its value (or result)
 without changing the behavior of the program.

If a function is pure, then calling it with the same arguments always gives the same result.
Therefore, any call to that function can be swapped with its result → that’s referential transparency.

Key Points

Depends on purity
Only pure functions are referentially transparent.
Impure functions (with side effects) are not referentially transparent.

Substitutability
If f(2,3) always returns 5, you can replace f(2,3) with 5 anywhere in your program, and nothing breaks.

Predictability
Code is easier to reason about because expressions are consistent and interchangeable with their values.





Use Cases / Why Important

Makes code easier to test → replace function calls with expected values.
Helps in reasoning about correctness of programs.
Enables compiler optimizations (e.g., memoization, lazy evaluation).
Foundation of functional programming languages like Haskell.

✅ Quick Memory Trick

Pure functions ⇒ Referential Transparency.
Impure functions ⇒ No Referential Transparency.
If you can “replace with the result” safely, you have referential transparency.

// first class functions
// functions are treated like any other value

/* 
// First-Class Functions
functions are treated like any other value.
That means in JavaScript:

Functions can be assigned to variables
Functions can be passed as arguments
Functions can be returned from other functions
Functions can be stored in data structures (arrays, objects)


>> This is why higher-order functions, closures, and functional programming are natural in JS.

Key Points

Functions are objects in JS → they can have properties, be referenced, and manipulated.
This makes higher-order functions possible (functions that take/return functions).
Enables powerful patterns like callbacks, closures, currying, and functional programming.




Examples
1. Assigning to variables
const greet = function(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
};

console.log(greet("Hesham")); // "Hello, Hesham"

2. Passing as arguments
function processUserInput(fn) {
  const name = "Hesham";
  console.log(fn(name));
}

processUserInput(greet); // "Hello, Hesham"

3. Returning functions
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function(num) {
    return num * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

4. Storing in data structures
const operations = [
  x => x + 1,
  x => x * 2,
  x => x - 3
];

let value = 5;
for (const op of operations) {
  value = op(value);
}
console.log(value); // ((5+1)*2)-3 = 9

*/

  return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Hesham")); // "Hello, Hesham"

function processUserInput(fn) {
  const name = "Hesham";
  return fn(name);
} 
console.log(processUserInput(greet)); // "Hello, Hesham"

// higher order functions
/* 

A Higher-Order Function (HOF) in JavaScript is a function that either 
Takes one or more functions as arguments, or Returns a function as its result, or both.



*/

function multiplier(factor) {
  return function (x) {
    return x * factor;
  };  
}
const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
const triple = multiplier(3);
console.log(triple(5)); // 15 



/* 

Immutability means that once a data structure (object, array, variable) is created, it cannot be changed.
If you want to “modify” it, you create a new copy with the updated values, leaving the original unchanged.


Key Points

Primitives are immutable
Numbers, strings, booleans → cannot be changed.
Example: "hello"[0] = "H" does nothing; string stays "hello".

Objects and arrays are mutable by default in JS
But you can choose to treat them immutably by creating copies.

Functional programming prefers immutability
Easier to reason about (no hidden changes).
Prevents bugs caused by shared mutable state.

React & Redux rely on immutability
State updates must create new objects, not mutate old ones.




Examples

✅ Immutable Update
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

// Instead of mutating with push
const newArr = [...arr, 4];

console.log(arr);    // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

❌ Mutable Update
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // modifies the original
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]



Objects
const person = { name: "Hesham", age: 25 };

// immutable update with spread
const updated = { ...person, age: 26 };

console.log(person); // { name: "Hesham", age: 25 }
console.log(updated); // { name: "Hesham", age: 26 }






Why Immutability Matters

Predictability → no hidden changes to objects.
Debugging → easier to track where data changes.
Concurrency → safe when multiple parts of a program access the same data.
React → detects changes via shallow comparison of old vs new state.



Tools for Immutability
Spread operator (...)
Array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, slice, concat)
Libraries: Immer.js, Immutable.js



✅ Memory trick:
Immutability = “don’t change the thing, make a new thing.”

*/




/* 

Recursion is when a function calls itself (directly or indirectly) in order to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems.

Key Points


Base Case
A condition that stops the recursion, preventing infinite calls.

Recursive Case
The part of the function where it calls itself with a smaller/simpler input.

Stack
Each recursive call is pushed onto the call stack.
Too many recursive calls without a base case → stack overflow error.




Examples
1. Factorial (classic recursion)
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;   // base case
  return n * factorial(n - 1); // recursive case
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // 120

2. Fibonacci Sequence
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;   // base cases: 0 or 1
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(5)); // 5

3. Recursion vs Iteration
// iteration
function sumIterative(n) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) sum += i;
  return sum;
}

// recursion
function sumRecursive(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 0; // base case
  return n + sumRecursive(n - 1); // recursive case
}

console.log(sumIterative(5)); // 15
console.log(sumRecursive(5)); // 15






Use Cases

Tree and graph traversal (DOM tree, file systems).
Divide and conquer algorithms (merge sort, quicksort).
Problems naturally defined in recursive terms (factorials, Fibonacci).
Backtracking (solving mazes, Sudoku).




✅ Memory Trick

Recursion =

Base case → when to stop
Recursive case → keep breaking problem down
Think: “solve small piece + delegate the rest to myself”

*/



/* 


Recursion is considered a functional programming (FP) approach because:

Functional programming avoids loops
Many functional languages (like Haskell) don’t even have traditional for or while loops.
They use recursion as the main way to repeat actions.

Immutability fits recursion
Loops often mutate counters (i++) or accumulators.
Recursion can work without mutating variables → it just returns new values.

Declarative style
Recursion expresses what the solution looks like, not how to iterate step by step.
That matches FP’s declarative mindset.

*/




/* 

🔹 Recursion (normal)

Recursion = a function calls itself.
Example → factorial:

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);  // recursive call
}


Problem: after the recursive call factorial(n - 1) finishes, the function still has to multiply by n.
This means the current function frame must stay alive in memory → stack grows.
For very large n, you’ll get a stack overflow error.



🔹 Tail Recursion

A function is tail-recursive if the recursive call is the last thing the function does.
Nothing is left to do after the recursive call returns.

Example → factorial rewritten as tail-recursive
function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
  if (n === 0) return acc;
  return factorial(n - 1, acc * n); // recursive call is the last operation
}


Notice: no extra multiplication after the recursive call returns.
All the work is passed into the acc (accumulator).
This makes it eligible for tail-call optimization (TCO), if the engine supports it.




🔹 Why Tail Recursion is Better

In languages with TCO (like Scheme, Haskell), the engine reuses the current stack frame → no stack growth.
That means you can recurse millions of times without stack overflow.

In JavaScript (except Safari):
Tail recursion works logically, but still grows the stack → still unsafe for very deep recursion.


*/



/* 

Why Tail Recursion Can Be Worse in JS

A tail-recursive function carries an extra accumulator parameter, which means each recursive call adds more data onto the stack.
Since JS doesn’t optimize tail calls, every call still consumes stack space.
For very large inputs, the tail-recursive version can blow the stack faster than a compact normal recursive version.



Example:

Normal factorial

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


Tail-recursive factorial

function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
  if (n === 0) return acc;
  return factorial(n - 1, acc * n);
}

#####################################
Try with a large n (e.g., 100000):
Both will crash with RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
But the tail-recursive one often crashes sooner, because each frame has a bit more work (extra parameter passing).
#####################################



4. Best practice in JS
For large numbers or deep recursion → don’t rely on recursion in JS
Use iteration (for, while) or simulate TCO manually with a trampoline

✅ Summary

Tail recursion is only better if the engine supports TCO (not true in JS, except Safari).
In JS, both normal recursion and tail recursion will overflow the stack for large inputs.
Tail recursion can even be worse because of the extra accumulator parameter overhead.

*/




/* 

Trampolining is a technique to convert recursive function calls into an iterative process so you can avoid stack overflow.

Instead of recursion going deeper and deeper on the call stack, each recursive step returns a thunk (a function describing the next step).
A special function (the “trampoline”) repeatedly executes those thunks in a loop until a final value is produced.


🔹 Why Do We Need It?

In most languages with tail-call optimization (TCO) → tail recursion is safe.
In JavaScript → most engines (V8, SpiderMonkey) don’t support TCO → recursion still overflows for large inputs.
Trampolining is a workaround: you implement your own stack using thunks and a loop.

🔹 How It Works

Write your recursive function so it returns a function (thunk) instead of calling itself directly.
A trampoline function takes that initial function and keeps evaluating until the result is a value, not a function.

🔹 Trampoline Utility
function trampoline(fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    let result = fn(...args);
    while (typeof result === "function") {
      result = result();  // call the thunk
    }
    return result;
  };
}

🔹 Example 1: Factorial
function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
  if (n === 0) return acc;
  return () => factorial(n - 1, acc * n); // return thunk
}

const safeFactorial = trampoline(factorial);

console.log(safeFactorial(5));       // 120
console.log(safeFactorial(100000));  // ✅ works, no stack overflow

🔹 Example 2: Fibonacci (Tail Recursive)
function fibonacci(n, a = 0, b = 1) {
  if (n === 0) return a;
  if (n === 1) return b;
  return () => fibonacci(n - 1, b, a + b);
}

const safeFibonacci = trampoline(fibonacci);

console.log(safeFibonacci(10));     // 55
console.log(safeFibonacci(100000)); // ✅ no stack overflow

🔹 When Trampolining is Best

Works best with tail-recursive functions → each step is easy to turn into a thunk.
Can be applied to non-tail recursion, but it’s messy.



Benefits

Prevents stack overflow in deep recursion.
Lets you keep the elegance of recursion in JavaScript (where TCO isn’t available).
Keeps function logic clean (no manual loop writing).

🔹 Limitations

Overhead: each step creates a thunk (extra function). Slightly slower than a simple loop.
Not built-in: you must implement trampoline logic yourself.
Messy with non-tail recursion: not as clean as tail recursion.

✅ Summary

Trampolining = “bounce” recursive calls into a loop.
Use it in JavaScript when recursion is natural but risks stack overflow.
Best with tail recursion, possible (but messy) with normal recursion.
It simulates tail-call optimization (TCO) manually.

/* 

Two separate recursion problems:

Stack overflow → solved by Tail Call Optimization (in some langs) or Trampolining (in JS manually)
Overlapping subproblems (repeated branches) → solved by Memoization / Dynamic Programming

*/

🔹 Trampolining vs Overlapping Subproblems

Trampolining only fixes the stack overflow problem (space complexity).
Overlapping subproblems is about time complexity (too many duplicate calls).
They’re independent problems:
Trampolining makes recursion safe for large depths.
Memoization/dynamic programming makes recursion efficient for overlapping calls.

✅ Summary

Overlapping subproblems = time complexity issue (too slow).
Stack overflow = space complexity issue (too deep recursion).
Memoization fixes time.
Trampolining (or TCO) fixes space.



Trampolining only affects space complexity (stack usage), not time complexity

Before trampolining:

Every recursive call consumes a new stack frame.
For n recursive calls, stack depth = O(n)
Deep recursion → stack overflow

After trampolining:

Recursion is converted into iteration using thunks + loop.
Stack depth = O(1), constant space.
No stack overflow.
